Obtaining the Data 

Re-Running the Experiments 

The python file credit-fraud-models.py has all the code for training models, tuning hyperparameters for each model, and plotting. In the main method, the data is already loaded into a data frame and is ready for use. It is also split into train and test data. The terminal command "python3 credit-fraud-models.py" will run any function you would like. Everything is commented, so uncomment whatever function you want to run and it will output results for you. Each function is commented with its function, whether it be tuning, plotting, or training. 

The following libraries should be installed using pip: matplotlib, scikit-learn, numpy, pandas.
